# Beschdlcrypt
Beschdlcrypt is a collection of software especially made for cryptography by me, Beschdl.

So, the software I'm developing right now is a collection of "Open-Source" Encryption-Algorithms.
Some of them are just hexadecimal or similar. Which means, that the text is just translated in a different coding, nothing more.
So, the current program consists of 3 Algorithms:
 -Base64
 -Base32
 -Hexadecimal
I am working on different stuff, I always upload a "Todo" on pastebin.com, this is the link: https://pastebin.com/u/Beschdl

The program is completely programmed with python, some of the code is just imported from a module, e.g. The SHA algorithms.
Yeah, the logo is self made, yes, it is horrible, and yeah, it is difficult to pronounce "Beschdl"

Thanks for reading all of this, thanks for the support (If you even do, if you don't, do), and yeah... cya

PS: I'm 14, so help and constructive critic is always appreciated.
